# 1. 为什么要用规则？
老话:**解耦**

Rule执行链条？
如果一个rule太复杂，不容易维护。使用链的方式更容易维护。

Atomicity of rules
> we should try to make our rules as simple as possible to the point that they cannot be divided into anything smaller, which could still be considered a rule. This principle is called Rule Atomicity.

Ordering of rules
order由Engine决定的，order对rule不重要，rule只关心数据。
